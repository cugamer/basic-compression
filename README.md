Basic Compression
-----------------

This is a basic program which takes in a string, then compresses it by representing any repeating character sequences as a count of the given character.  All code is contained in the executable file.  To run the file simply navigate to the location folder, then run ```./basic_compression StringGoesHere```; the output will then be displayed in the terminal.  Should an erroneous string be entered an error will be displayed.
